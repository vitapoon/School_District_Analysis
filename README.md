# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis
The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that there are some evidences of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered.Therefore Maria has asked me to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once you’ve replaced the math and reading scores, Maria would like me to repeat the school district analysis that you did in this module and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## Resluts
1, How is the district summary affected?
The only change is a 0.1% drop in avg math scores between the two analyses

2, How is the school summary affected?
The only change is within Thomas High Schools statistics as both math and reading scores drop by 0.3 %.

3, How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
Thomas High School's scores fell heavily dropping them from 4th to 7th highest scores in the district
 
4, How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
> Math and reading scores by grade

> Scores by school spending
The $630 to $644 range saw a drop from 63% to 56% overall passing percentage

> Scores by school size
The 1000 to 2000 size schools saw a drop from 91% to 85% overall passing percentage

> Scores by school type
The charter type schools saw a drop from 90% to 87% overall passing percentage

## Summary
Without the 9th graders' scores, Thomas High School is not as competitive with other charter schools.

Without Thomas High School, the overall 9th graders' scores fell.

Without the 9th graders' scores, the district summary changes much less than the Thomas High School.
